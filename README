If you want to re-populate the SVN metadata that can quickly be done by taking your up-to-date clone of leto's repo off of gihub and adding this to your .git/config

[svn-remote "svn"]
  url = https://burn-osx.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/burn-osx
  fetch = trunk:refs/remotes/trunk
  
Then run this command to find the "top commit"

git show origin/master | head -n 1

and put that commit hash into a file .git/refs/remotes/trunk (obviously replace the has with the one from the above command)

echo d4a448fc8f9ee9d5869c14c582e4c2bb26415790 > .git/refs/remotes/trunk
